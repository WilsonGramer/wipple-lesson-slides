    # Patterns in Wipple

    Wipple and other functional programming languages use **patterns** to structure and make decisions about data. We'll spend the next two weeks on patterns.

    Thinking with patterns will take some getting used to, but understanding how they work is rewarding ‚Äî knowing how to plan and architect data structures is a valuable skill no matter which languages you use in the future.

<section>
    # Creating patterns

    In Wipple, a pattern is one **option** or **possibility** for a value. To list all the possibilities, you use the `type` keyword:

    <aside>
        ```wipple
        -- List all the possible shapes we want to describe
        Shape : type {
            Triangle
            Circle
            Square
        }

        -- Give the `my-shape` variable the value `Triangle`
        my-shape : Triangle
        ```
    </aside>
</section>

<section>
    `Shape` is capitalized and represents a name for our group of patterns.

    <aside>
        ```wipple {2}
        -- List all the possible shapes we want to describe
        Shape : type {
            Triangle
            Circle
            Square
        }

        -- Give the `my-shape` variable the value `Triangle`
        my-shape : Triangle
        ```
    </aside>
</section>

<section>
    `Triangle`, `Circle`, and `Square` are individual *values*, just like a number or a string.

    <aside>
        ```wipple {3-5,9}
        -- List all the possible shapes we want to describe
        Shape : type {
            Triangle
            Circle
            Square
        }

        -- Give the `my-shape` variable the value `Triangle`
        my-shape : Triangle
        ```
    </aside>
</section>

<section>
    # Matching patterns

    Even though we wrote `Triangle` in the example above, Wipple **only remembers that `my-shape` is a `Shape`** ‚Äî Wipple treats `Triangle`, `Circle`, and `Square` as interchangeable. Because of this, if you want to do something with a shape (eg. display it on the screen with `show`), you have to check _every possibility_.

    <aside>
        ```wipple
        -- Wipple forgets `Triangle` and only remembers `Shape`
        my-shape : Triangle
        ```
    </aside>
</section>

<section>
    Wipple has a built-in keyword named `when` that checks each possibility for us. Similar to `if`, we can run different code depending on which pattern is present.

    <aside>
        <BigCode>
            ```wipple
            when
            ```
        </BigCode>
    </aside>
</section>

<section>
    There are 3 steps to using `when`:

    1. Write `when my-shape` (or whichever variable you want to check).

    <aside>
        ```wipple {9}
        Shape : type {
            Triangle
            Circle
            Square
        }

        my-shape : Triangle

        when my-shape {
            Triangle -> show "It's a triangle ‚ñ≤"
            Circle -> show "It's a circle ‚óè"
            Square -> show "It's a square ‚ñ†"
        }
        ```
    </aside>
</section>

<section>
    2. Look at the `Shape` type to see all the possible patterns.

    <aside>
        ```wipple {1-5}
        Shape : type {
            Triangle
            Circle
            Square
        }

        my-shape : Triangle

        when my-shape {
            Triangle -> show "It's a triangle ‚ñ≤"
            Circle -> show "It's a circle ‚óè"
            Square -> show "It's a square ‚ñ†"
        }
        ```
    </aside>
</section>

<section>
    3. Between braces (`{ }`), create one **function** for each possibility. The parameter is the pattern to match.

    <aside>
        ```wipple {10-12}
        Shape : type {
            Triangle
            Circle
            Square
        }

        my-shape : Triangle

        when my-shape {
            Triangle -> show "It's a triangle ‚ñ≤"
            Circle -> show "It's a circle ‚óè"
            Square -> show "It's a square ‚ñ†"
        }
        ```
    </aside>
</section>

<section>
    Since `my-shape` stores `Triangle`, `when` chooses the first function.

    <aside>
        ```
        It's a triangle ‚ñ≤
        ```
    </aside>
</section>
